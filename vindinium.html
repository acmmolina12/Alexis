<h2><font color="white"><p></p> Vindinium is where students create Ai and make them fight other similar Ai's in vindinium. It's a game where you create your own Ai and make the Ai find gold and make it fight other Ai's that gets close to it. It's like minecraft because in minecraft you can also look for gold stuff and can fight other creatures that try to attack. In the vindinuim you have no control of the Ai and you program it to do specific tasks. The only difference between these two is that minecraft you don't get to fight other people, you fight animals that are dangerous and that try attacking you. The picture above this paragraph is not mine because I didn't get a chance to see it last time we had class but it looks something similar to the robots that we created in class. </font></h2>

    <h2><font color="white"><p>What the code basically does is that when ever the bot has low healt h he will go to a tavern to get some more health. It also finds the distance from the bot and the closest tavern. The for loop wtih the initialized variable i goes through each of the taverns, finds the closest tavern, and sets the variable closetavern to the closest tavern found. </p></font></h2>

<h2><font color="white"><p> What the code above tells the robot to do is to find mines. It also tells the distance fromt the closest mine to the bot. It's like a guidance to something reliable. In line 55 it means that the longer the Ai is in there the more money it gets. </p></font></h2>
 
 <img src="images/killbots.png" alt "right" style="width:1200px;height:280px;">  
 <h2><font color="white"><p> This code helps the bot kill any bot close to my bot. This helps keep the bot get ready from anyy other close bots from it because any bot on the vindinuim will attack if my bot is close to the other bot. It also lets the bot know the distance from the enemy bot to my own bot. In line 81 it means that the more it's close to another bot the more damage the other bot will take.</p></font></h2>

     <h2><font color="white"><p> It loops trhough each of the mines that are available and finds the closest one.  After this, it sets the direction towards the mine and proceeds to move towards it. It loops through each of the taverns that are available and finds the closests one. After this it sets direction towards the tavern and proceeds to move forward.  </p></font></h2>


    <img src="Shortcode.png" alt "right" style="width:1200px;height:600px;"> 
     <h2><font color="white"><p> It pushes all Ai's that aren't yours to in array of enemy Ai's, since the definition of an enemy bot is a bot that is not yours.  When mine count equals to 0 mines it makes to Ai go look for mines. If minecount is not equal to 0 and health is less than 50 it makes the Ai go to taverns. If the mine count is not equal to 0 and the health is greater than 50 than the Ai goes to kill enemies.</p></font></h2>
